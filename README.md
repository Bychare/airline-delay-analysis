#  Airline Delay Analysis

This project aims to analyze flight delay data and create predictive models to estimate how much a flight will be delayed.
The dataset used is from [Kaggle – Airline Delay Analysis](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sherrytp/airline-delay-analysis).

##  Dataset

The dataset includes information about:
- Flight date and time
- Airline, origin, and destination
- Distance, taxi-in/out times, and more
- Delay status (target)

## ⚙ Models Used

A variety of models were trained and compared:
- Ridge Regression
- Lasso Regression
- ElasticNet
- k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- XGBoost
- CatBoost
- LightGBM
